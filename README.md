# PDF 2 Kindle

### Summary
This is a tool to firstly convert a PDF file of a book from websites such as pdfdrive into a epub file. This epub file is then emailed to a the address of your kindle which means that you can now read it as a e-book.

### What I learned:
- The use of commands from within Python code
- The basics of the Cailbre CLI to convert files to different formats
- The uses of the patlib library to manage paths to various folders more effectively
- Sending emails in Python with attachments
- How to set up a new recognised sender for emails on a Kindle
